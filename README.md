# Challenge 1

## Description

A marketing website has been provided with complete code. The goal of this project is to clean up the source code into a more readable and manageable format.

## Developlment Process

After scanning the code and ensuring that it would render correctly, changes were first made to the html. Alt text was added to all image elements. The text of the title in the head element was also updated. The attached CSS stylesheet was then examined for potential improvements. To improve readability, all class styling was grouped into sequential order. This included making sure that styling was applied to parent elements immediately followed by their direct children. The page was then loaded in a browser and compared side by side to the original source code to ensure they looked and functioned the same.

## Provided User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Crtieria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
